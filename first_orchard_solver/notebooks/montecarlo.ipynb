    "###This notebook first simulates and then solves a game I play with my young daughter often. In this game you roll a die, if you roll a die with a color you take a fruit of that color from its tree. There are 4 types of these fruits. One other side of the die is the raven. If you roll the raven 5 times before getting all the fruits from the trees you lose. The last die is a basket where you choose which color you would like to would like to take from the tree. And this choice is what is being investigated in terms of win percentages. "

    "###run_batches simulates playing many batches of games using different strategies. The different strategies pertain to when you have a choice of moving a fruit of your choice from the basket, you can choose one at random (random_strategy), from one of the fruit type that have the most left (largest_strategy), or from one of the fruit type that have the least left (smallest_strategy). run_batches lets the user run x number of batches of x number of games. In the above code I set it for 10000 batches of 100 games for a total of 1000000 games. And this is for each strategy for a grand total of 3000000 games played between three different strategies. Fuller testing is in test_game_solver.py and logs for this testing are in test_validation.log"
