    "###This notebook first simulates and then solves a game I play with my young daughter often. In this game you roll a die, if you roll a die with a color you take a fruit of that color from its tree. There are 4 types of these fruits. One other side of the die is the raven. If you roll the raven 5 times before getting all the fruits from the trees you lose. The last die is a basket where you choose which color you would like to would like to take from the tree. And this choice is what is being investigated in terms of win percentages. "

    "###run_batches simulates playing many batches of games using different strategies. The different strategies pertain to when you have a choice of moving a fruit of your choice from the basket, you can choose one fruit at random, from one of the fruit types that have the most left, or from one of the fruit type that have the least left. run_batches lets the user run x number of batches of x number of games. In the above code I set it for 10000 batches of 100 games for a total of 1000000 games. And this is for each strategy for a grand total of 3000000 games played between three different strategies. Fuller testing is in test_game_solver.py and logs for this testing are in test_validation.log for most items in this notebook, but with less verbal explanation."
