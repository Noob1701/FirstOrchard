A simple but fun Python notebook based on my 3 year old's game My First Orchard.

This repo has analytically solved and confirmed by simulations that the odds of winning with the best strategy is 63.2% from the start of the game. With the right inputs it can also calculate odds of winning from any game state and compare two game states.  

Currently this repo has a minimally playable text based version in gameplay.py that allows the user to know what the odds are of winning after a choosing a fruit based on a wild roll. 

This tool is an educational project to simulate and analyze win probabilities in cooperative childrenâ€™s games, inspired by First Orchard by HABA.
It is not affiliated with or endorsed by HABA, and does not use any proprietary game content. The project was built to explore real-time state evaluation for gameplay scenarios.
